The implication of this rule is that each test must be loaded with a fresh dataset and may have to do some cleanup afterwards. This standard is that this is handled by setUp() and tearDown() methods.

    "- (REQUIRED) When something goes wrong or has to be changed, and if your code has a good set of tests, you or other maintainers will rely largely on the testing suite to fix the problem or modify a given behavior. Therefore the testing code will be read as much as or even more than the running code. \n",

When someone will have to work on the code base, running and reading the related testing code is often the best thing that they can do to start. They will or should discover the hot spots, where most difficulties arise, and the corner cases. If they have to add some functionality, the first step should be to add a test to ensure that the new functionality is not already a working path that has not been plugged into the interface."
