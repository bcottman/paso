**paso** is  a python package for structured data machine learning. **paso** is Spanish for the English word step. 
A **paso** class or function is a step in your analysis pipeline. 
Because **paso** follows a protocol, the set of all operations in **paso** 
can be called a framework. 

Data engineers and Machine Learning Scientists appreciate
the value of having their tools span across the data science 
workflow. The framework **paso** has been designed to fit 
in such all encompassing frameworks, as mlflow and Berkeley 
Data Analytics Stack(BDAS). It has been designed for pre-processing 
and post-processing data wrangling to and from learning packages such 
as PyTorch, Tensorflow, XGBoost and scikit-learn.  It has been designed 
to work with a large number of evolving visialization tools such as facet, 
matplotlib, seaborn, Tensorboard, and plotly, to name just a few.

You can contribute to the **paso** Project in many ways. Below are listed some of the areas:

- Fix a typo(s) in documentation.
- Improve some of the documentation.
- Fix typo or/and improve a docstring(s).
- Report a documentation bug.
- Improve existing test or/and code more tests.
- Execute test suite for a distribution candidate and report any test failures.
- Post a new issue.
- Fix a bug in a issue.
- Re-factor some code to add functionality or improve performance.
- Suggest a new feature.
- Implement a new feature.
- Improve or/and add a lesson.

Remember to post in issues the proposed change and if accepted it will be closed.
See [issues](https://github.com/bcottman/paso/issues) or [projects](https://github.com/bcottman/paso/projects/1) for open issues for the **paso** project.

You can find a issue , or you can post a new issue, to work on. 
Next, or your alternative first step, you need to set-up your local **paso** 
development environment.  Code, Documentation and Test can have separate or 
shared environments. Each one is discussed in the documentation..

**Installation** 

**paso** requires ``python3.5`` or above.
 
Because **paso** has many external files, you need to copy repo at https://github.com/bcottman/paso. 
All lesson files in paso/lessons show how to update sys.path.

Someone is welcome to clean this up for more patiable use by public.
