**paso** is a set of function and class method operations for data wrangling Machine
for Learning and Deep Learning models.
**paso** is Spanish for the English word step. A **paso** class or function is a step in your
analysis pipeline. Because **paso** follows a protocol, the set of all operations in **paso** can be
called a framework.

Data engineers and Machine Learning Scientists appreciate the value of having their tools span
across the data science workflow. The framework **paso** has been designed to fit in such all
encompassing frameworks, as mlflow and Berkeley Data Analytics Stack(BDAS). It has been designed for
pre-processing and post-processing data wrangling to and from learning packages such as PyTorch,
Tensorflow, XGBoost and scikit-learn. It has been designed to work with a large number of evolving
visialization tools such as facet, matplotlib, seaborn, Tensorboard, and plotly, to name just a few.

You can contribute to the **paso** Project in many ways. Below are listed some of the areas:

-  Fix a typo(s) in documentation.
-  Improve some of the documentation.
-  Fix typo or/and improve a docstring(s).
-  Report a documentation bug.
-  Improve existing test or/and code more tests.
-  Execute test suite for a distribution candidate and report any test failures.
-  Post a new issue.
-  Fix a bug in a issue.
-  Re-factor some code to add functionality or improve performance.
-  Suggest a new feature.
-  Implement a new feature.
-  Improve or/and add a lesson.

Remember to post in issues the proposed change and if accepted it will be closed. See
`issues <https://github.com/bcottman/paso/issues>`__ or
`projects <https://github.com/bcottman/paso/projects/1>`__ for open issues for the **paso** project.

You can find a issue , or you can post a new issue, to work on. Next, or your alternative first
step, you need to set-up your local **paso** development environment. Code, Documentation and Test
can have separate or shared environments. Each one is discussed in the documentation.

**Installation**

**paso** requires ``python3.5`` or above.

::

     pip install paso
