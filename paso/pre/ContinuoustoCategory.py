    Transforms any numpy array or any pandas dataframe
    of continuous values (``int` or ``float` arrays) to category bins.

    Parameters:
        verbose: (str) default: True
            logging on/off (``verbose=False``)


    Note:
        Datasets that are used as ``train``, ``valid``, and ``test``
        shpuld have same ``miny`` and  `` maxy``, so as to have same
        range, so as the same bin widths and labels and thus the
        same categories.

        Assumes **paso** ``EliminateUnviableFeatures()`` and other data
        cleaning steps (such as removal of Null and NA values)
        has been done previous to this.

        No matter the type of the input dataset it  will be returned
        as ``DataFrame``. If you want to set the feature names, call ``toDataFrame``
        before this function.

        Fixed-width bin, only works, WITHOUT SCALING, with datasets with multiple features
        for tree-based models such as CART, random forest, xgboost, lightgbm,
        catboost,etc. Namely Deep Learning using neural nets won't work.

        **Statistical problems with linear binning.**

        Binning increases type I and type II error; (simple proof is that as number
        of bins approaches infinity then information loss approaches zero).
        In addition, changing the number of bins will alter the bin distrution shape,
        unless the distribution is uniformLY FLAT.

        **Quantile binning can only be used with a singular data set.**

        Transforming a Continuous featuree ino a Category feature based on percentiles (QUANTILES) is WRONG
        if you have a train and test data sets. Quaniles are based on the data set and will be different unless
        each data set is distribution is equal. In rhe limit there are only two bins,
        then almost no relationship can be modeled. We are essentially doing a t-test.

        **if there are nonlinear or even nonmonotonic relationships between features**

        If you need linear binning, not quantile, use
        ``quantile_bins=False`` and specify the bin width (``delta``) or  fixed bin boundaries
        of any distribution of cuts you wish with ``nbin`` = [ cut-1, cut-2...cut-n ]

        **If you want Quantile-binning.**

        Despite the above warnings, your use case may require. qantile binning.
        Quantile based binning is a faily good strategy to use for adaptive binning.
        Quantiles are specific values or cut-points which partition
        the continuous valued distribution of a feature into
        discrete contiguous bins or intervals. Thus, q-Quantiles
        partition a numeric attribute into q equal (percetage-width) partitions.

        Well-known examples of quantiles include the 2-Quantile ,median,
        divides the data distribution into two equal (percetage-width) bins, 4-Quantiles,
        ,standard quartiles, 4 equal bins (percetage-width) and 10-Quantiles,
        deciles, 10 equal width (percetage-width) bins.

        **You should maybe looking for outliers AFTER applying a Gaussian transformation.**
